# My Weak Aura Collection

These WeakAuras are intended for the following conditions:
* Default UI setup at 100% zoom.
* Bottom-left and bottom-right action bars enabled.

# How to Import
* Download and install [WeakAuras 2] (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/weakauras-2).
* While in-game, type /wa in chat.
* Click 'New' in the top-left corner. Then click 'Import' at the bottom.
* Copy and paste a string of your choice from one of the .txt files. Upon doing so, the game may stutter or lag for several seconds. This is natural, as the game is converting the strings into functional WeakAuras.
* Accept the import and your done. You can customize things from here.
* The Lua tables are for documentation purposes. I don't even know how to use Lua.

# Why WeakAuras?
* WeakAuras allow players to track vital information with flashy, hard-to-ignore graphics.
* This vital information is often glanced over or hard-to-notice in the default interface.

# Notes

### Warrior
* Tracks Rend duration and glows at optimal refresh time.
* Enrage is in here, but Arms doesn't even have it anymore. Derp.
